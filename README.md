In this project, I have solved some of the basic questions in **Java** to improve my Logical thinking.

##  Requirements and Installation process

Run the following commands on your terminal to install java on your linux system.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt update; sudo apt install oracle-java8-installer
```
After finishing installation, you can compile the file like `javac your_file_name.java`.

To run that compiled class file, type `java your_compiled_class_file_name`

To check the version of java after installing, that you're using, run - `javac --version`.
